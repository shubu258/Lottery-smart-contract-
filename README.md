# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users should be able to enter the raffle by paying for a ticket. The ticket fees are going to be the prize the winner receives.
2. The lottery should automatically and programmatically draw a winner after a certain period.
3. Chainlink VRF should generate a provably random number.

4. Chainlink Automation should trigger the lottery draw regularly.

## Tests!

1. write deploy scripts 
   1. note , these will not work on zksync
2. write tests 
   1. Local chain
   2. Forked testnet
   3. Forked mainnet
